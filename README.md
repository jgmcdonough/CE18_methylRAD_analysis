## analysis folder
contains scripts and generated data files/figures from the various analyses
- **Differential Methylation Analysis** - identified significantly differentially methylated genes between treatments
- **GO enrichment analysis** - matching gene ontology (GO) terms with significant differentially methylated genes, and testing for enrichment of GO terms
- **KEGG pathway analysis** - aligning identified significant genes to pathways with KEGG

## pipeline counts folder
