# Figures

## NMDS plots
generated from [DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb)


## Volcano plots
Statistically significant differentially methylated genes in each pairwise comparison - data originally generated in [DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb), but ggplot generated from [HC_genes_2.0.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/HC_genes_2.0.ipynb)

these plots differ in how the grids are labelled (HC vs. hyp cont conventions)


## DMG_venn
Overlap of differentially methylated genes in pairwise comparisons - data originally generated in [DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/DESeq_geneFeatures.ipynb), but venn diagram generated from [HC_genes_2.0.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/HC_genes_2.0.ipynb) with ggvenn
