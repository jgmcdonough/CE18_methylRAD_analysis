### featureCounts.ipynb
generates counts matrix of features (i.e., exons) and meta-features (i.e., genes)

### DESeq_analysis.ipynb
Identifies significantly differentially methylated genes in pairwise comparisons, as well as NMDS plots

### HC_genes.ipynb
Volcano plots of DESeq results (ggplot) and other downstream analysis (Venn diagram, GO terms)
