Results from running DESeq for each pairwise comparison. Contains results for *all* genes, even if not significant. 

For a list of *only* significant genes, see [sig_DMGs](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/tree/master/analysis/deseq_res_files/sig_DMGs) 

File shorthand:
- CC vs. CH = control control vs. control hypoxic
- CC vs. HC = control control vs. hypoxic control
- CC vs. HH = control control vs. hypoxic hypoxic
- CH vs. HC = control hypoxic vs. hypoxic control
- HH vs. CH = hypoxic hypoxic vs. control hypoxic
- HH vs. HC = hypoxic hypoxic vs. hypoxic control
- Hx vs. Cx = phase 1 hypoxic vs. phase 1 control (ignoring effects of phase 2)
- xH vs. xC = phase 2 hypoxic vs. phase 2 control (ignoring effects of phase 1)
