## deseq_res_files

This folder contains the DESeq results for each of the pairwise comparisons, converted into dataframes and saved as csv files. These contains *all* of the genes, including non-significant DMGs. 

- CC vs. CH = control control vs. control hypoxic
- CC vs. HC = control control vs. hypoxic control
- CC vs. HH = control control vs. hypoxic hypoxic
- CH vs. HC = control hypoxic vs. hypoxic control
- HH vs. CH = hypoxic hypoxic vs. control hypoxic
- HH vs. HC = hypoxic hypoxic vs. hypoxic control
- Hx vs. Cx = phase 1 hypoxic vs. phase 1 control (ignoring effects of phase 2)
- xH vs. xC = phase 2 hypoxic vs. phase 2 control (ignoring effects of phase 1)
