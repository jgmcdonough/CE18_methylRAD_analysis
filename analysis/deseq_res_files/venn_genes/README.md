# Venn_genes

This directory contains CSV files of unique and shared DMGs in pairwise comparisons


DMGs were first identified in [DESeq_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/DESeq_analysis.ipynb) and then further analyzed with a Venn diagram visual in [HC_genes.ipynb](https://github.com/jgmcdonough/CE18_methylRAD_analysis/blob/master/analysis/DMGs_analysis/HC_genes.ipynb)


All resulting CSV files are based on this venn diagram visual of overlap of DMGs in pairwise comparisons:
